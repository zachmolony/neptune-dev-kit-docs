# Products

The `useProducts` hook provides a set of functions to retrieve products.

## Usage

```js
import { useProducts } from "neptune-dev-kit";

const { products, getProducts } = useProducts();
```

The `useProducts` hook requires a provider to be wrapped around the component that uses it. The provider is `ProductProvider` and it can be imported from `neptune-dev-kit`. Feel free to wrap this around you're entire app or just the component that uses the Product.

```js
import { ProductProvider } from "neptune-dev-kit";

const App = () => (
  <ProductProvider>
    <Component />
  </ProductProvider>
);
```

## products

The `products` object contains the current state of the products. It has the following structure:

```js
[
  {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    description: string,
    price: number,
    images: [
      {
        id: string,
        url: string,
        alt: string,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

## getProducts

The `getProducts` function retrieves products from Neptune. It accepts a query object as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves to the updated products.

```js
const query = {
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
  sort: "name",
  order: "asc",
};

getProducts(query).then((products) => {
  console.log(products);
});
```
