# Products

The ```neptuneProducts``` hook provides a set of functions to retrieve products.

## Usage

```js
import { neptuneProducts } from 'neptune-kit';

const { products, getProducts } = neptuneProducts();
```

The ```neptuneProduct``` hook requires a provider to be wrapped around the component that uses it. The provider is ```ProductProvider``` and it can be imported from ```neptune-kit```. Feel free to wrap this around you're entire app or just the component that uses the Product.

```js
import { ProductProvider } from 'neptune-kit';

const App = () => (
  <ProductProvider>
    <Component />
  </ProductProvider>
);
```

## products

The ```products``` object contains the current state of the products. It has the following structure:

```js
[
  {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    description: string,
    price: number,
    images: [
      {
        id: string,
        url: string,
        alt: string,
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## getProducts

The ```getProducts``` function retrieves products from Neptune. It accepts a query object as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves to the updated products.

```js
const query = {
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
  sort: 'name',
  order: 'asc',
};

getProducts(query).then((products) => {
  console.log(products);
});
```
